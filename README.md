## **About the Project**  
At Plymouth Housing, managing in-kind donations efficiently has been a significant challenge. Currently, these donations are tracked manually, leading to frequent errors and inconsistencies. This outdated system complicates the distribution of essential items to residents, delaying their access to necessary resources and impacting their quality of life.

Digital Aid Seattle is stepping in to revolutionize Plymouth Housing’s operations with a new, centralized inventory management system. Designed with ease of use in mind, the system will require minimal training, enabling staff and volunteers to quickly adapt. It will feature real-time updates, straightforward data export capabilities, and comprehensive dashboards.

The deployment of this inventory management system is set to significantly enhance operational efficiency at Plymouth Housing. By ensuring a smoother flow of donations from intake to distribution, we will facilitate faster and more reliable access to necessary resources for residents.

## Code Formatting

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to maintain a consistent code style. The configuration for Prettier is defined in the `.prettierrc` file at the root of the project.

To exclude specific files or directories from formatting, you can add them to the `.prettierignore` file.

To format your code, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx prettier --write .
```
This command will automatically format all the files in your project according to the rules specified in the .prettierrc file.

If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can also set up Prettier to automatically format your code every time you save a file. Here's how:

- Install the Prettier extension from the VS Code marketplace.
- Open the settings (File > Preferences > Settings or Ctrl + , on Windows, Cmd + , on Mac).
- Search for "Format On Save" and make sure the "Editor: Format On Save" option is checked.
- Search for "Default Formatter" and select "Prettier - Code formatter".
- Now, every time you save a file, Prettier will automatically format it for you.
